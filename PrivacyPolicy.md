# HistoryDex-Privacy-Policy
# What data is collected
- User IDs to identify you in the database.
- Server (or guild) IDs, this is used to store settings necessary to the bot’s operation.
- Channel IDs, this is used to know which channel the collectibles shall spawn.
**In addition, the following data to HistoryDex is created and used**
- The list of collectibles owned by a user of the service.
- A history of trades done on collectibles, including the users that once owned the said collectible but do not anymore.
# How the data is stored
All the data is stored on a PostgreSQL server, which runs on my operating system of Windows 10, protected by VPNs and a strong firewall to ensure user data is not breached nor abused. Interaction between the bot and the database is exclusively local using Tortoise ORM.
# Access to the data
The only person that accesses and views any data is the application only. 
Only dark3nd has direct access to the code and self-hosting application. dark3nd does not use the data, and only the bot does to ping the PostgreSQL server and use the bot to function properly. Users’ data will never be made public, and the access to the data is secured accordingly.
# Your rights
You may request a copy or the deletion of your personal data held by the application by contacting the application owner. The recommended way is sending a message and/or friend request to dark3nd on Discord, or emailing “historydex.dark3nd@gmail.com”.
